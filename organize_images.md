## Steps to Organize:

2. Rename 4 male images to: `male-1.png`, `male-2.png`, `male-3.png`, `male-4.png`
3. Rename 5 female images to: `female-1.png`, `female-2.png`, `female-3.png`, `female-4.png`, `female-5.png`
4. Delete the remaining screenshot files to keep the directory clean

## Current Screenshots Available:
You have 85+ screenshot images in the directory. Please manually review and select the best 9 images (4 male, 5 female) that look professional and authentic for Indian influencers.

## Terminal Commands to Rename (examples):
```bash
cd /Users/sanketmane/Collabuzz/astra/public/images/influencers
mv "Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 1.19.41 PM.png" "male-1.png"
mv "Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 1.19.48 PM.png" "female-1.png"
# ... continue for all 9 images
```

Once you've renamed the images, the website will automatically load them!
